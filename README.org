* Greap
=====

This is a repository to host the Greap, a project using the LeapMotion device.
To use this you need to download a latest stable version of SuperCollider, and GECO.
GECO is used to map out the Leap's data into SuperCollider. Currently the software is using MIDI protocol for that.

Download SC from here:http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/

GECO can be found at LeapMotion's AppSpace.
